#' Precipitation data
#'
#' @description Three precipition datasets off the SW coast of India.  Two are satellite derived and one is based on land gauges.
#' 
#' @details
#' The National Climatic Data Center provides basic information on the GPCP Precipitation dataset.  The dataset consists of monthly precipitation estimates (average mm/day) from January 1979 to the present. The precipitation estimates merge several satellite and in situ sources into a final product. Data are provided on a 2.5 degree grid.  The GPCP Precipitation data are provided by the NOAA/NCEI Global Precipitation Climatology Project and were downloaded from \url{https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-precipitation-climatology-project-gpcp-monthly}.  Two boxes were defined, one off the Kerala coast and one off the Karnataka coast, and the average values of all grid points within these boxes were used.
#' \preformatted{
#' The boxes are 
#' Kerala Lat(8.75,  11.25), Lon(73.25,  75.75)
#' Karnataka Lat(13.75,  16.25), Lon(71.25,  73.75)
#' }
#' 
#' The land gauge data is monthly, seasonal and annual rainfall (in mm) area weighted average for each state in India starting from 1901 onwards. This data set is based on rain guages.  The data are provided by the India Meteorological Department (Ministry of Earth Sciences).  The 1901 to 2014 data were downloaded from the Open Government Data Platform India \url{https://data.gov.in}.  The raw data are in the file 'Area_Weighted_Monthly_Seasonal_And_Annual_Rainfall_0.csv' in the extdata folder.  The 2015 and 2016 data were extracted from the yearly Rainfall Statistics reports (see references).
#' 
#' NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) website provides background on the TRMM data (\url{https://pmm.nasa.gov/}).  1997 to 2015 monthly precipitation estimates on a 0.25 degree grid were downloaded from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) website.

#' Monthly tide height data from Cochin
#' 
#' @aliases tidelevel
#'
#' @description Tide height data were downloaded form three sources to provide a 1939 to 2018
#' time series of tide height at Cochi. The Cochi tide gauge is on Willington Island; 
#' \href{https://www.gloss-sealevel.org/gloss-station-handbook?stn=32}{GLOSS# 032}, UH#174, 
#' \href{http://www.ioc-sealevelmonitoring.org/station.php?code=coch}{IOC#coch}
#' and \href{https://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/stations/438.php}{PSMSL#438}.
#' The data are the raw tide gauge values, which are the mm above the datum for this gauge.  The datum
#' is 1.94m below BM27.
#'   
#' Sea level measurements are affected by the local barometric pressure, and
#' it is common to apply the inverted barometer correction which uses
#' the difference between the current air pressure and the mean air pressure.
#' However Srinivas and Kumar (2006) found that for the Cochin tide height measurements,
#' "There is no significant difference between the seasonal march of the observed 
#' sea level and CSL [corrected sea level]". Therefore we use the raw sea level data with no
#' correction.
#'  
#' Srinivas et al. (2005) and Srinivas and Kumar (2006) found a positive correlation
#' between the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and mean sea level for 1976-1993,
#' with the sea level decreasing during El Nino years and increasing during La Nina years. 
#' Singh (2006) also found this correlation but for Sept only for Cochin. A Singh (2006) also found
#' a correlation between the monthly rainfall in the SW monsoon season and mean sea level. Srinivas
#' and Kumar (2006) also found a relationship between the along shore winds and sea level height at
#' Cochi. Note that this relationship between sea level and SOI does not seem to hold for the entire
#' 1939-2018 time series.
#' 
#' @details
#' 
#' For 1939 to 2013, mean monthly tide height was downloaded from the Permanent Service for Mean
#' Sea Level (PSMSL), (PSMSL 2019, Holgate et al. 2013). This is from the tide gauge at Cochin on 
#' Willington Island (Lat 9.966667, Lon 76.266667). The data are the raw tide level data, termed
#' the 'metric' data on the PSMSL website. Download link was 
#' \url{https://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/met.monthly.data/438.metdata}
#'
#' In 2011, a automatic tide gauge was installed which provides minute tide height data. Data
#' from 2011 onward are provided by Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS)
#' and hosted at \url{http://www.ioc-sealevelmonitoring.org} and the
#' University of Hawaii Sea Level Center (UHSLC) \url{https://uhslc.soest.hawaii.edu/}. Research quality
#' data are not available for Cochin (UH# 174). Instead the Fast Delivery data were used
#' and quality control (outlier removal) was applied to the downloaded data per the algorithm 
#' used by IOC Sea Level Monitoring (FAQ \url{http://www.ioc-sealevelmonitoring.org/service.php}).
#' 
#' Daily minute tide level data were downloaded from \url{http://www.ioc-sealevelmonitoring.org/station.php?code=coch}
#' and outlier removal applied.
#' \itemize{
#'  \item All values X where abs(X ‚Äì median) > tolerance are hidden.
#'  \item With tolerance = 3*abs(percentile90 - median)
#'  \item The statistics (median and percentile90) are calculated on the daily minute data
#'  }
#'  After outlier removal, NAs were replaced with a linear interpolation and 
#'  the mean tide height for the day (average over all the minute data) was computed. The daily
#'  data were then averaged over the calendar month to create the monthly average. Months with
#'  fewer than 20 days of data were given NA.
#'  was computed.
#'  
#'  Daily mean tide level was also downloaded from the
#' University of Hawaii Sea Level Center (UHSLC) at the link \url{http://uhslc.soest.hawaii.edu/data/?fd#uh174}.
#' This data should be the same as the IOC data above but there were slight differences that
#' are likely due to differences in outlier removal and how NAs are treated. As for the IOC data, he daily
#'  data were then averaged over the calendar month to create the monthly average. Months with
#'  fewer than 20 days of data were given NA.
#'  was computed. The reference for these data are Caldwell et al. (2015).
#'  
#'  A monthly time series for 1939 to 2018 was assembled by merging the 3 data sets. The PSMSL data
#'  were used for 1939 to Aug 2011. For Sept 2011 onward, the IOC and UHSLC monthly data were averaged.
#'  If one had a NA and the other did not, the non-NA value was used. The monthly data had NAs. The NAs
#'  were interpolated using exponential smoothing (ETS) via a seasonal model. 
#'  \itemize{
#'  \item An ETS model was fit to the data up to the first NA
#'  \item The fitted ETS model was used to forecast one step ahead.
#'  \item The one-step ahead forecast was used to fill in the first NA
#'  \item A new ETS model was fit to the data up to the second NA, where the first NA was filled in via the step above.
#'  \item The new fitted ETS model was used to forecast one step ahead.
#'  \item This one-step ahead forecast was used to fill in the second NA.
#'  \item This process was repeated until all NAs were replaced.
