\title{Fit linear regression with covariate value in specific quarter as the covariate for all quarter of a year}
\usage{
retfit.qtr(covname, catch.qtr = 1:4, yearlag = 0, cov.qtr = 1,
  boxes = 1:14, qtr.effect = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{covname}{name of the covariate.  Must be a colname in seio_covariates_qtr.  If one of the covariates is from the boxes, then specify the part of the name in front of the number.}

\item{catch.qtr}{what quarter(s) of catch to use as the response}

\item{yearlag}{If 0, it means covariate in current year, where a sardine year starts in Q3.}

\item{cov.qtr}{the quarter to use for the covariate.}

\item{boxes}{for covariate from a box, the box number or numbers to use}

\item{qtr.effect}{whether to make the covariate effect on catch depend on the quarter in which the catch is from}
}
\value{
An lm object of the fit
}
\description{
Fit a linear regression model where the covariate value in specific quarter is the covariate 
that explains all quarters of catch in a specific year.  A 'year' for sardine starts in 
Q3 and goes to Q2 of the next year.  The effect of a covariate can be specified to be
quarter specific, that is catch in Q1 may respond differently to the covariate than
catch in Q4. Note: this is an outdated function not used once I switched to GAMs.

\examples{
#Effect of precip in box 5 in qtr 1 in the previous year on catch
retfit.qtr("Precip", yearlag=1, cov.qtr=1, boxes=5)
